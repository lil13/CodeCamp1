            Stephen Paul "Steve" Jobs is an American entrepreneur who has been widely recognized as a pioneer of the IT era. 
            One of the founders, chairman of the board and CEO of Apple. One of the founders and CEO of Pixar.
            In the late 1970s, Steve and his friend Steve Wozniak developed one of the first personal computers to have great 
            commercial potential. The Apple II computer became the first mass-produced product of Apple, created on the initiative 
            of Steve Jobs. Jobs later saw the commercial potential of a mouse-controlled graphical interface, which led to the advent
             of the Apple Lisa and, a year later, the Macintosh (Mac).
            After losing the power struggle to the board in 1985, Jobs left Apple and founded NeXT, a company that develops a computer 
            platform for universities and businesses. In 1986, he acquired the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, turning it 
            into a Pixar studio. He remained Pixar's CEO and major shareholder until the studio was acquired by the Walt Disney Company in 2006,
             making Jobs the largest private shareholder and board member of Disney.

            <li>Steve drove a car (Mercedes SL55 AMG) without license plates and parked in places for the disabled 
                (however, after a liver transplant in 2009, he became entitled to it). There were rumors that Steve
                 used a barcode instead of signs.</li>
            <li>
                n the last years of his life at public events he usually wore the same clothes - a black turtleneck, Levi's jeans (model 501) 
                and New Balance sneakers (models 991 and 992).
            </li>
            <li>Jobs' annual salary after returning to Apple was $ 1</li>
            <li>On the day of his death, many sites in the IT community changed their design a bit - added links to his biography, inserted quotes 
                in the interface.</li>
            <li>
                In early August 2011, the speech of Steve Jobs, abducted by Raisa Bogatyreva, caused great indignation in the foreign press. On June 28, 2011, 
                during a speech to graduates of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, the official used whole pieces of Jobs' speech to Stanford graduates in 2005.
